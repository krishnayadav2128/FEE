            <h2>Alice in Wonderland</h2>
            <p>Author: Lewis Carroll</p>
            <p>Review: Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll is a story about Alice who falls down a rabbit hole and lands into a fantasy world that is full of weird, wonderful people and animals. It is classic children's book that is also popular with adults. Personally, at 16, I found the book strange and uninteresting. However if I was 8-14 I would have loved the fantastic fantasy world Carroll creates. I never expected the events that happened because they were bizarre and unpredictable. I loved the Cheshire cat's wit and intelligence. I also love the hatter because his eccentric personality reminded me of the eccentric people I know. My favourite part was when Alice met the caterpillar, this was because of his ambiguous conversation with Alice.

                However, I thought the events were sometimes random and didn't always connect. I also disliked the number of characters, this is because sometimes I found it uninteresting and sometimes it meant that I didn't have the development of scenes I wanted.
                
                I believe that it is a clever book that I world have preferred when I was younger because now I have a different taste in books. Carroll has depicted a unique world that I hadn't seen before. This why I believe it is a book that I would recommend.
                
ople of the dangers of a naive and ignorant common-class. It is critical for anyone willing to help make a change in the political world and fight for freedom, and offers for a wonderful experience for casual readers and historians alike, as the novel holds much historical significance as well. On the whole, George Orwell's Animal Farm is a masterpiece with an amazing plot and ever-relevant lesson, and has undoubtedly earned its author a spot among the best authors of the 20th century.</p>
